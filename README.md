📊 Financial Risk Management — VaR & Expected Shortfall (ES)

An interactive web application to compute, visualize, and backtest the Value at Risk (VaR) and the Expected Shortfall (ES) using real financial market data.


🎯 Project Objective

This academic project (Master SEP — University of Reims, 2025–2026) aims to:

Compute the 99% VaR using two approaches:

Parametric (Normal distribution)

Historical (Empirical)

Compute the 97.5% Expected Shortfall

Perform backtesting over the last year of data:

Kupiec test for VaR

Empirical comparison for ES

Provide a fully interactive web interface to explore these risk measures.
